##Getting started

This project is built with [Gradle] (http://www.gradle.org/). We use a feature called the "gradle wrapper" that will automatically install
Gradle if you don't have it already. You can generate an IDE template by typing `./gradlew cleanIdea idea` from the command line. This
will generate project files for [Intellij IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). Build the project and run all unit tests by typing
`./gradlew ci`.You can get information on other tasks by typing `./gradlew tasks`.

**Note that this software requires Java 7 or 8 and JodaTime 2.3.**
